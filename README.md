In this task, my goal was to predict a continuous value on anonymous data. 

In general, the obtained data were numerical, evenly distributed with various parameters according to the uniform law. I used the following Feature Engineering methods as: Normalization, KBest, PCA, Clustreing. Also I have tried such algorytms: RandomForest, ElasticNet Regressor, SVR.
